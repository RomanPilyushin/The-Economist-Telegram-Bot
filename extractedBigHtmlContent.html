<div class='news-block'><h2>A cold war in Ukraine</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20231118_dap357.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>The Indian summer Ukraine experienced during much of October and November has come to an end, with snow and sub-zero temperatures expected in parts of the country this week. Elsewhere, this would mean woollen socks and mulled wine. In Ukraine, it means more air-raid sirens, renewed Russian missile attacks on the country’s energy grid, and the threat of power outages and cold homes. The start of winter will also probably mark the end of Ukraine’s counter-offensive, which appears to have run out of steam some time ago. The coming months are unlikely to see any major breakthroughs by the Ukrainians, the country’s top military commander recently warned. Time is not on Ukraine’s side. Russia can draw on far bigger stocks of weapons, ammunition, and manpower. Ukraine, meanwhile, faces the risk of a slowdown in American military assistance. A tough winter looms.</p></div>
<div class='news-block'><h2>A discreet birthday at the White House</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20231118_dap361.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>Joe Biden turns 81 on Monday, a milestone that his team will seek to play down. Last year the White House hosted his granddaughter’s wedding the day before he became an octogenarian. The timing, CNN reported, was “not a coincidence”. Coverage focused less on the president’s quiet birthday brunch than on Naomi Biden’s bridal gown.</p><p>But no amount of spin will make Americans forget Mr Biden’s age. In a recent poll of registered voters in six swing states, the figures around the president’s fitness were among the starkest: 71% thought he was too old for the job. There is little he can do on that front. More unsettling were trends among non-white voters. They are traditionally steadfast Democrats, but 42% of Hispanic and 22% of black voters said they would opt for Donald Trump. As he blows out the candles on his cake, Mr Biden’s birthday wish will be to lower those numbers.</p></div>
<div class='news-block'><h2>Africa seeks more investment</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/tinubu.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>African leaders are racking up the air miles in their quest for investment. Earlier this month many of the continent’s presidents were in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, for the first-ever Saudi-Africa summit. On November 20th some will attend the G20 “Compact with Africa” conference in Berlin. The German-inspired initiative was launched in 2017 to promote private investment in 13 participating African countries. Backed by the G20 bloc and multilateral banks, the initiative helps members develop economic, financial and business reforms and links them to investors.</p><p>Its record so far is disappointing. Investment in members of the compact has barely increased, and other African countries have been creating jobs more quickly. The Nigerian president, Bola Tinubu (pictured), is flying to Berlin to court investors even though his country is not part of the scheme. Africa’s well-travelled presidents will want to return home with more than jet lag.</p></div>
<div class='news-block'><h2>America, Japan and the Philippines counter China</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20231118_dap365.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>Marines from America, Japan and South Korea are heading back to barracks on Monday after 12 days of exercises with local counterparts in the Philippines. The exercises, which involved 2,700 troops, focused on coastal defence, with some held on islands facing internationally disputed waters. The Philippines contests parts of the South China Sea with China; further north, Japan and China contest part of the East China Sea.</p><p>America supports Japan and the Philippines in resisting Chinese expansionism, and has separate alliances with both. But it also has a bigger interest in preventing China from forcibly absorbing the self-governing island of Taiwan. In turn, both Japan and the Philippines, like Taiwan, depend on the threat of American intervention to deter China. They plan more such tripartite training exercises among the rest of their forces.</p></div>
<div class='news-block'><h2>Iceland volcano threatens to erupt</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20231118_dap360.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>Icelanders are warily watching a volcano on the country’s south-western Reykjanes peninsula; for the past few days, it has been threatening to blow. Thousands of earthquakes have been recorded in the area—a warning that an eruption could be imminent. A large crack now runs through streets of Grindavik, a small fishing town on the peninsula. Residents were evacuated a week ago. Also nearby is the Svartsengi geothermal power station, which provides electricity and hot water to thousands of homes (and the Blue Lagoon, a popular bathing spot). The government is building defensive barriers around the station to protect it from flowing magma.</p><p>Volcanic activity near the Reykjanes peninsula picks up every millennium or so, with the last spate occurring about 800 years ago. Scientists say that, based on the increase in seismic activity in recent years, the icy island has entered another fiery phase. It could last for centuries.</p></div>
