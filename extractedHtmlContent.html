     <h3 class="_headline">Israel’s progress in Gaza</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>After almost three weeks of ground fighting, <a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2023/11/15/the-battle-of-northern-gaza-is-almost-over">Israel now has control </a>of the area north of Wadi Gaza, a riverbed that bisects the 45km-long Gaza Strip. This heralds the end of one phase of the war against Hamas. Israeli forces have dislodged the militant group from power in this part of the enclave. The group that has controlled Gaza since 2007 is scattered and reeling.</p>
       <p>Yet Israel has still to find Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, and its military chief, Muhammad Deif. Both are thought to be hiding in the maze of tunnels beneath the enclave. Israeli troops will spend the coming weeks blowing up the entrances to those tunnels and scouring the north for arms and militants. Inevitably, some Hamas fighters will have fled to southern Gaza, along with civilians. At some point, therefore, Israel will have to turn its attention south. How much it will be able to do there, however, will depend on domestic politics and diplomatic pressure.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">America avoids a shutdown</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>As early as Thursday Joe Biden is set to sign into law a bill that averts a government shutdown. The news is welcome—if perplexing. In September Republican Kevin McCarthy, then the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, <a href="/united-states/2023/10/01/by-averting-a-government-shutdown-kevin-mccarthy-risks-his-job">defied</a> hardliners in his party and relied on Democratic votes to pass a short-term funding bill to avoid a shutdown. He was summarily defenestrated. Six weeks later, Mike Johnson, his replacement (pictured), did largely the same thing. Yet, for now, his job is safe.</p>
       <p>Mr Johnson, knowing that Republicans would get the blame for a shutdown, needed a short-term solution. Though the bill lacked military aid for Israel or Ukraine, it was acceptable to Democrats because it included no spending cuts. Some members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus voted against it, but following the <a href="/united-states/2023/10/26/americas-house-of-representatives-finally-has-a-speaker">weeks-long scramble</a> to replace Mr McCarthy, even they were not keen on more chaos. Overall, Republicans are giving Mr Johnson “a longer leash”, as one pundit put it, than the divisive Mr McCarthy.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">Harder times at Alibaba</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>China’s biggest shopping day, Singles’ Day, which falls on November 11th, was something of a flop this year. E-commerce sales declined by 1% year on year. That is in keeping with this year’s sluggish trend in consumer demand. It is not good news for Alibaba, which has the biggest share of the e-commerce market.</p>
       <p>Investors got a sense of just how bad things are on Thursday. Alibaba posted a quarterly net income of 27.7 billion yuan ($3.8 billion), an improvement on the net loss it made for the same period last year but lower than expected. Worse still, the company called off plans to spin-off its cloud computing business into a separate company, blaming American export controls on computer chips. The move throws into doubt the rest of the company’s ambitious restructuring plan of <a href="/business/2023/03/30/alibaba-breaks-itself-up-in-six">splitting </a>itself into six separate businesses, announced in March. Alibaba shares fell after the news. The company’s Single’s Day was poor, but its break-up is going even worse.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">A new AI badge could change how we use technology</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>Naomi Campbell wore it first. A small pin on the lapel of an angular, pinstriped blazer intrigued onlookers at a fashion show in September. It was no mere decorative accessory. Instead it was a device intended to make handheld smartphones obsolete. On Thursday the AI Pin will be available for early orders in America.</p>
       <p>Created by Humane, a startup staffed by former Apple employees, the AI Pin is a smart-assistant that attaches to clothing using a magnet. It differs from conventional smartphones by having no screen. Nevertheless, it takes photos, can access the internet, make phone calls, and project text onto surfaces (using lasers).</p>
       <p>Generous funding of $240m from Microsoft, OpenAI and others has generated huge expectations in the tech market. Critics worry that a wearable device powered by generative artificial intelligence poses challenges for data protection. Using the pin will also require a substantial behavioural shift. Liberating the world from its smartphone addiction may yet require more technology.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">Giorgia Meloni’s passion for Frodo</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>An exhibition that has precious little to do with art, but much to say about the cultural enthusiasms of <a href="/leaders/2023/11/09/giorgia-melonis-mother-of-all-reforms-is-a-power-grab">Giorgia Meloni</a>, the Italian prime minister, and her hard-right Brothers of Italy party, opens to the public on Thursday at the National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rome.</p>
       <p>The show is devoted to the British writer J.R.R. Tolkien, author of “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings”. Exhibits include manuscripts and letters, first editions of his books and art works inspired by his tales. Tolkien’s fantasy sagas, embraced by hippies in the 1960s, found a radically different set of admirers in Italy where they became the favoured reading of young neo-fascists. Ms Meloni, who once belonged to the neo-fascist youth movement, attended its “Hobbit Camps”. She has since often quoted from Tolkien’s works. Why Tolkien? For her culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano, his writings reflect “opposition to the most controversial and dehumanising aspects of modern times”.</p>
