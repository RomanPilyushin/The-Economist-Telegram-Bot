      <p><strong>Israeli</strong> troops entered al-Shifa hospital in the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong> to conduct a “precise and targeted operation” against <strong>Hamas</strong>. The Israel Defence Forces said <a href="/israel-hamas">the raid </a>was “based on intelligence information and an operational necessity”.

John Kirby, America’s national-security spokesperson, said militants were storing weapons at al-Shifa. Doctors at the hospital, where thousands are sheltering, have denied the claims.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">Biden and Xi meet</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>On Wednesday, for only the second time during his presidency, Joe Biden will hold face-to-face talks with Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart. The meeting will take place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in San Francisco. Messrs Biden and Xi are expected to discuss a range of issues, including the Israel-Hamas war, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the future of Taiwan and Sino-American economic relations.</p>
       <p>Dialogue between America and China broke down last year when a suspected Chinese <a href="/china/2023/02/09/tensions-will-linger-over-a-chinese-balloon-downed-by-america">spy balloon</a> was spotted flying over America—and Mr Biden ordered that it be shot down. Since then officials have tried to <a href="/china/2023/10/12/chinas-ties-with-america-are-warming-a-bit">reduce</a> tensions. A priority for America at these talks will be to restore communications between the two countries’ armed forces. That seems achievable. So, too, does a deal to stem the flow of Chinese-made fentanyl into America. But neither side is expecting bigger breakthroughs. Just a more stable relationship would be a good outcome.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">Britain’s asylum scheme ruled unlawful</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>In April 2022 Britain’s government announced a solution to the problem of asylum seekers crossing the English Channel in small boats. They would be sent to Rwanda where their claims would be processed. On Wednesday, however, the Supreme Court nixed that plan, upholding an earlier ruling by the court of appeals which said the plan would breach the European Convention on Human Rights<em>. </em></p>
       <p>Its decision may revive suggestions among the ruling Conservative Party that Britain should leave the ECHR. That, however, may be less likely since Monday, when James Cleverly replaced Suella Braverman, the hardline home secretary who championed the plan. Britain’s highest court, meanwhile, made it clear that the reason Rwanda was not a suitable destination—the risk that it would send asylum seekers back to unsafe countries—violated a number of treaties, not just the ECHR. The ruling leaves a flagship government policy in tatters.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">A contentious tech summit in Lisbon</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>Web Summit, an annual gathering of techies, is under way in Lisbon. About 70,000 attendees from across the globe are expected in Portugal’s capital, making the event one of the largest of its kind. Among the speakers are Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, Chelsea Manning, an American whistleblower, and Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Portugal’s president. Unsurprisingly, artificial intelligence is prominent on the agenda.</p>
       <p>The event was thrown into turmoil last month when Web Summit’s co-founder Paddy Cosgrave tweeted remarks critical of Israeli attacks on Gaza, following the massacre of Israelis by Hamas militants on October 7th. A number of high-profile speakers backed out of the event, as did sponsors, including Amazon, Google and Intel. Mr Cosgrave resigned as boss of the event, though he maintains a majority stake in the business. His replacement, Katherine Maher, will be hoping that the summit happens without further controversy.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">Turkish Airlines’ questionable priorities</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>On Wednesday Turkish Airlines will start flying to Detroit, its 13th American destination. <a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/23/turkey-is-making-a-big-diplomatic-and-corporate-push-into-africa">Turkey’s national carrier</a> now flies to more countries than any other airline. Yet there is widespread criticism that the company, which is 49% state owned, is becoming increasingly politicised.</p>
       <p>Fatmanur Altun, the wife of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s press chief, joined the airline’s board in June 2019. Ten months later Melih Sukru Ecertas, a prominent member of the youth wing of ruling Justice and Development party, became a board member. Two other recent appointees graduated from the Kartal Imam Hatip, a religious high school, in the same year as Mr Erdogan’s son.</p>
       <p>Controversies are mounting. A recent rule allows the airline’s pilots and cabin crew to break for prayers in flight, albeit not during “critical” phases of the flight, and fast for Ramadan. This is in line with Mr Erdogan’s policy of weakening modern Turkey’s secularist traditions. But even airlines run by governments that are more strictly Islamic do not allow this. In August a pilot was dismissed for calling the rule a safety risk. That has raised concerns about the airline’s priorities.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">The business end of cricket’s World Cup</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>After a long group stage of 45 matches, the only real question to be answered in the remaining three matches of the <a href="/asia/2023/10/04/narendra-modi-has-seized-and-politicised-indian-cricket">Cricket World Cup</a> is can anyone <a href="/culture/2023/11/10/india-are-dominating-the-cricket-world-cup-will-they-choke">stop India</a>? The hosts have won all nine of their group matches. Only England reined in their ferocious batting, holding them to 229-9, India’s lowest score of the tournament. But if India’s batsmen don’t get you, their bowlers will. (England were all out for 129 in response.) In the first semi-final on Wednesday, India face New Zealand. They will be seeking revenge, after New Zealand knocked them out of the previous tournament in 2019.</p>
       <p>In the other semi-final, Australia face South Africa, who must slough off their reputation for choking. When the two sides contested a World Cup semi in 1999 South Africa were heading for victory, until their last pair of batsmen got in a horrendous tangle and were run out. Both sides have performed well over the past weeks—but not as well as India. The final is on Sunday.</p>
