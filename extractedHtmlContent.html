     <h3 class="_headline">Is a hostage deal on the horizon?</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>On Friday Israel’s army will continue searching the <a href="/leaders/2023/11/16/the-rights-and-wrongs-of-israel-and-hamas-at-al-shifa-hospital" data-tegid="dar4ueu1cls7vfa6i67h8kf5689ph0p4">al-Shifa hospital</a> in Gaza for proof that it is a Hamas stronghold. The Israel Defence Forces released photos of what they claim are entrances to Hamas tunnels in the healthcare facility. The IDF also said it had found “intelligence materials”, weapons, and the bodies of two of the hostages taken by Hamas in buildings near the hospital.<br><br>
         There is mounting <a href="/middle-east-and-africa/2023/10/24/netanyahus-handling-of-the-hostage-crisis-enrages-israelis">pressure</a> on Israel’s government to make progress on the release of hostages. It hopes that the al-Shifa raids will push Hamas into freeing some of the people they are holding. Qatari, Egyptian and American negotiators are reportedly trying to broker a deal in which Hamas would release dozens of hostages and share a list of who else is being held. In return Israel would release some Palestinian women and children from prison and allow more aid to enter Gaza. It might even pause fighting.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">India’s state elections</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>Voters in Madhya Pradesh, a central <a href="/newsletters/essential-india">Indian</a> state with a population of 72m people, will elect a new legislative assembly on Friday. The vote is one of several state elections this month. Neighbouring Chhattisgarh continues voting on Friday. Rajasthan, a big state in the north, goes to the polls on November 23rd. Telangana, in the south, does so a week later. All votes will be counted on December 3rd.</p>
       <p>Analysts will watch the results of the state elections for signs of what may happen in a national election to be held in spring. In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the two most important in this round of voting, polls suggest that the country's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is neck and neck with its biggest rival, Congress.</p>
       <p>If Congress does well this month its candidate for prime minister is more likely to head an opposition coalition with a better shot of winning the national election. If it does not, the opposition’s chances of unseating the prime minister, Narendra Modi, will look slim.</p>

     <h3 class="_headline">Erdogan’s tense visit to Germany</h3>
     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, will meet Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, in Berlin on Friday. Talks will focus on <a href="/europe/2021/11/06/sixty-years-of-turkish-guest-workers-in-germany">economic partnerships</a> and the Middle East. Germany is Turkey’s most important trading partner. The relationship remains strong, even though Turkey’s <a href="/finance-and-economics/2023/06/01/turkeys-bizarre-economic-experiment-enters-a-new-phase">unorthodox approach</a> to dealing with high inflation recently spooked investors. Germany invested more than $23bn in Turkey in 2022 and bilateral trade is expected to surpass $50bn this year.</p>
       <p>But political relations are strained. The <a href="/international/2023/11/13/from-gaza-to-ukraine-wars-and-crises-are-piling-up">Israel-Gaza conflict</a> has driven a wedge between Turkey and its Western partners. Mr Erdogan has described Hamas as “liberators” and accuses Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza, abetted by the West. Germany has been more supportive of Israel’s position.</p>
       <p>Turkey’s treasury minister, Mehmet Simsek, appointed in June, has been trying to repair economic relations in visits to America, Europe and Gulf countries. He hopes to lure investors back with his <a href="/europe/2023/06/04/turkeys-president-erdogan-shifts-towards-sane-economics">promise of fiscal orthodoxy</a>. Rancour between Mr Erdogan and Mr Scholz in Berlin would make Mr Simsek’s job harder.</p>

       <p>The Los Angeles Motor show, which opens on Friday in eco-mad California, is usually a showcase for the latest battery-powered offerings. But this year, with electric-vehicle sales slowing down in America, the show will not set pulses racing.</p>
       <p>Apart from the Lucid Gravity, the second vehicle from a local startup, few new EVs will be on display. Carmakers will show off medium-sized SUVs and crossovers, with petrol or hybrid powertrains. Stellantis, whose brands include Chrysler and Dodge, will not be there at all. It is trying to save money after a recent <a href="/business/2023/09/20/americas-big-car-firms-face-lengthy-strikes">strike</a> by American car workers.</p>
       <p>The motor show’s future is uncertain. Most car firms prefer to launch important new models at their own events. Detroit’s show, once the country’s leading event in the home of its car industry, has faded in significance. The LA Motor show may share its fate.</p>

     <div class="_content">
      <div class=" css-111mrt0 ex3zz5c0">
       <p>Taika Waititi, a <a href="/prospero/2021/03/29/indigenous-film-makers-are-gaining-prominence">filmmaker from New Zealand</a> with an Oscar to his name, is one of life’s winners. Yet his latest film explores the plight of perennial losers. “Next Goal Wins”, released in America on Friday, tells the story of Thomas Rongen (played by Michael Fassbender), a Dutch-American coach who in 2011 tried to reverse the fortunes of American Samoa’s football team. At the time, the American overseas territory had probably the world’s worst international side: it had never won an official match and was still smarting from a memorable 31-0 loss to Australia ten years earlier.</p>
       <p>A documentary with the same name, released in 2014, has told this story before. Mr Waititi adds his <a href="/prospero/2019/10/21/jojo-rabbit-is-not-really-an-anti-hate-satire">quirky comedic style</a> to the narrative. He also pays more attention to the experiences of Jaiyah Saelua, a transgender player. Still, filmgoers intrigued by the tale will probably enjoy the documentary version more.</p>
