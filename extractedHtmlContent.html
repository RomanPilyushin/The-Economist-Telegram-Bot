  <p><strong>Israel </strong>reissued evacuation warnings to residents in <strong>southern Gaza</strong> as its army vowed to advance “wherever Hamas exists”. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled south to escape <a href="/israel-hamas">Israel’s assault</a> on the northern part of the enclave. Following pressure from America, Israel agreed to let two trucks of diesel enter the Gaza Strip every day. The return of fuel would allow the resumption of UN aid deliveries and the restoration of mobile communications in Gaza.</p>

  <p>Several companies, including Apple, Disney and IBM, suspended <strong>advertising</strong> on <strong>X</strong> (formerly Twitter) amid concerns over antisemitism on the social-media platform. The boycott was triggered by <a href="/finance-and-economics/2023/08/07/elon-musks-plans-could-hinder-twitternomics">Elon Musk</a> touting an antisemitic conspiracy theory on Wednesday. Mr Musk later said his tweet only referred to certain “Jewish communities”. Since purchasing X last year, Mr Musk has loosened the platform’s moderation policies and gutted its safety team.</p>

  <p>George Weah, <strong>Liberia’s</strong> leader, conceded defeat to Joseph Boakai in a presidential election. Mr Boakai, the opposition leader, has secured an unassailable 51% of the vote with counting almost complete. Mr Weah’s six-year term has been marred by food insecurity and unemployment.
