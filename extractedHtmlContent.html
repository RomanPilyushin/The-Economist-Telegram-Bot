  <p><strong>Argentina</strong> elected <strong>Javier Milei</strong>, a self-proclaimed “anarcho-capitalist”, as its president. Mr Milei defeated Sergio Massa, the economy minister, <a href="/the-americas/2023/10/23/argentinas-presidential-election-delivers-a-surprise-result">in a run-off</a>. With counting nearly complete, Mr Milei had secured 56% of the vote. Inflation was a top concern for voters—the annual rate stood above 140% in October. Mr Milei campaigned on a radical economic platform that included scrapping the central bank, dollarising the economy and slashing public spending by 15% of GDP.</p>

  <p><strong>Israeli tanks </strong>were reportedly closing in on the <strong>Indonesian hospital</strong> in northern Gaza. The enclave’s Hamas-run health ministry said there were some 700 people there; it claimed that 12 people were killed by artillery fire. Israel did not comment. Earlier, Israel released evidence it claims proves “Hamas is waging terror from hospitals,” showing apparent tunnels under <strong>al-Shifa</strong> <a href="/the-economist-explains/2023/11/18/was-israels-attack-on-al-shifa-hospital-justified">hospital</a>, Gaza’s largest facility.</p>

  <p>Iranian-backed <strong>Houthi</strong> rebels seized a cargo ship in the Red Sea, taking 25 crew members hostage. The rebels, who are based in Yemen, said they hijacked the vessel because of its links to <strong>Israel</strong>; last week the group warned that it considered all Israeli ships targets. Israel’s government insisted the vessel is British-owned and Japanese-operated. The ship’s owner is a firm registered in Britain but reportedly owned by an Israeli billionaire.</p>
