<div class='news-block'><h2>Argentina’s presidential run-off</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20231118_dap356.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>On Sunday Argentines cast ballots in a presidential run-off. In the first round of the election last month Sergio Massa, the economy minister, won almost 37% of votes. He topped the poll even though annual inflation is currently 143%. Javier Milei, a libertarian “anarcho-capitalist”, had been the front-runner but came second, with 30% of votes. Mr Massa is the candidate of Peronism, a populist movement that has governed the country for 28 of the past 40 years. His rival wants to “chainsaw” the political system and dollarise Argentina’s economy.</p><p>Mr Milei claimed, without evidence, that the first ballot was fraudulent. Since then the third-placed candidate, Patricia Bullrich, has backed his campaign. That could give Mr Milei the edge in the run-off. For the winner, the road ahead will be rocky. Argentina is struggling to pay a $44bn debt to the IMF, which expects the country’s GDP to shrink by 2.5% this year.</p></div>
<div class='news-block'><h2>Donald Trump’s high spirits</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20231118_dap353.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>On Sunday Donald Trump will be on America’s southern border, handing out tamales to Texas National Guardsmen. The event provides a chance for Mr Trump to talk up his immigration policies as he campaigns to be the Republican Party’s presidential candidate in 2024. Greg Abbott, Texas’s governor, is also expected to give his endorsement, though Mr Trump hardly needs the boost. The former president already leads his closest Republican challengers by double-digit percentage points. This month the New York Times released polls that showed him leading President Joe Biden, the almost-certain Democratic nominee, in five of six swing states that will be pivotal in the presidential election.</p><p>Mr Trump is campaigning hard in states like Iowa, which hosts the first primary contest in January. But the broader electorate has, for now, largely been spared his outbursts. His reintroduction to the country at large may cure Americans of any nostalgia.</p></div>
<div class='news-block'><h2>Big powers play in the Pacific Games</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20231118_dap351.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>The Pacific Games, a quinquennial tournament that officially begins in the Solomon Islands on Sunday, will be contested by 24 teams representing the region’s countries and territories. But it will also be the stage for a bigger competition between America and China for influence in the Pacific. And in that fight, Manasseh Sogavare, the Solomon Islands’ prime minister, has tacked towards China.</p><p>As a show of “friendship” China splurged $119m on a stadium and other facilities for the games. In turn, America’s allies, including Australia, have also chipped in as part of a wider diplomatic offensive to counter China’s growing security footprint in the island state. A coalition led by Australia has long kept the peace there, but Mr Sogavare has signed security and policing agreements with China. Both sides have bolstered their security contingents in Honiara, the capital, ahead of the tournament—a sign, as some in the region see it, of the risks of militarisation and of being caught up in the great game.</p></div>
<div class='news-block'><h2>A pill that could reduce opioid deaths</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20231118_dap349.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>Even small doses of fentanyl, a drug sold on American streets, can kill. To prevent such deaths, engineers have developed an ingestible device called a vitals-monitoring pill. The capsule contains sensors, a microprocessor and a radio, but can be swallowed as easily as a vitamin tablet. The pill transmits heart and respiratory rates wirelessly in real time by detecting tiny vibrations inside the body.</p><p>Medics, who receive such information from patients’ stomachs, can check their vital signs without calling them into a clinic. The researchers hope that in future the devices will be able to detect overdoses and automatically administer drugs to counter their effects.</p><p>When tested on pigs, VM pills successfully signalled when the animals’ breathing became dangerously low. The devices also accurately monitored the vital signs of ten humans with sleep apnoea. The technology could help fight the worst consequences of the opioid epidemic, which risks spreading beyond America to Europe.</p></div>
<div class='news-block'><h2>Weekend profile: Hemedti, the Sudanese warlord scenting victory</h2><img src='https://cdn.espresso.economist.com/files/public/images/20231118_dap339.jpg' alt='News Image'><p>In theory, he was the underdog. When war broke out in Africa’s third-largest country in April, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, universally known as Hemedti, was up against the might of Sudan’s central state. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the rebellious paramilitary group under his command, had tens of thousands of well-equipped troops. But it lacked tanks and fighter jets. He had manoeuvred himself into the post of de facto vice-president in an interim government set up in 2019. Mr Dagalo hankered for the top job. But most Sudanese despised him.</p><p>Seven months later, Mr Dagalo is winning his war against the Sudanese army. In recent weeks the RSF has chalked up several important victories in the warlord’s vast home region of Darfur in the west. Military analysts suggest it could soon try to take the rest of the country. About 6.2m Sudanese have been displaced since April alone; aid agencies say more than 6m are on the brink of famine. The UN calls it “one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history”.</p><p>But Mr Dagalo has never shown much concern for the wreckage his quest for power has wrought, especially against people who are not Sudanese Arab like himself. In the late 2000s, he was the most powerful militia commander in all of Darfur. His force, then known as the Janjaweed, was accused of committing genocide against the region’s African tribes on behalf of the country’s long-serving dictator, Omar al-Bashir.</p><p>In the following decade, Mr Dagalo built a sprawling transnational business empire specialising in mercenaries and gold mining. The Janjaweed was formalised as the RSF, and Mr Dagalo became Mr Bashir’s most trusted lieutenant. (The ousted dictator called him Hamayti, meaning “my protector”.) But in 2019 he turned on his patron, siding with pro-democracy demonstrators and engineering a coup which thrust him into office. Two years later, he took part in a second putsch, this time siding with the army to oust civilians from the power-sharing government that was set up after the fall of Mr Bashir.</p><p>Now Mr Dagalo claims—implausibly—that he is fighting against the generals in order to restore democracy. But conflict monitors warn of more genocidal violence should his forces prevail. Victory within grasp, he shows little interest in talks. Outsiders, distracted by events elsewhere in the world, display equally little appetite to halt his murderous march.</p></div>
