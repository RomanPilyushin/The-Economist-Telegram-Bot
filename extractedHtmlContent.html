  <p>Binyamin Netanyahu, <strong>Israel’s</strong> prime minister, said that his government was “making progress” on a deal with <strong>Hamas </strong>for the release of hostages. He has convened meetings this evening with the war cabinet, security cabinet and government. Earlier Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political chief, said the <a href="/finance-and-economics/2023/11/20/inside-hamass-sprawling-financial-empire">militant group </a>is “close to reaching a truce agreement” with Israel. The terms reportedly include Israel agreeing to a five-day pause in its offensive in the Gaza Strip in exchange for Hamas returning some of the hostages. Qatar, which is brokering the deal along with America, said that talks over the deal were at a “critical and final stage”.</p>

  <p><strong>North Korea</strong> fired what is suspected to be a <a href="/why-is-north-korea-launching-rockets-again"><strong>spy satellite</strong></a>, in its third launch attempt this year (both previous attempts failed). If it stays up, the satellite would give the country the means to monitor the movements of American and South Korean troops. Japan, which had condemned the launch after being warned in advance, told citizens on Okinawa, a southern Japanese island, to shelter.</p>

  <p><strong>Germany </strong>suspended new spending commitments, as the government grapples with a budgetary crisis caused by a <a href="/europe/2023/11/15/german-judges-toss-a-spanner-into-the-governments-spending-plans">controversial court ruling</a> last week. The judgement by the country’s highest court said that unspent government funds, originally earmarked for covid-19, could not be used for other purposes. Germany’s strict borrowing rules, the “debt brake”, leave the government with few other ways to raise funds.</p>

  <p><strong>Britain’s </strong>Supreme Court ruled that riders for Deliveroo, a food-delivery company, cannot be recognised as employees, in a landmark ruling for the gig economy. The court cited the riders’ ability to choose their own hours and delegate their orders to another person without Deliveroo’s involvement. In 2021 the court ruled that drivers for <a href="/britain/2021/03/18/ubers-workers-benefit-from-a-supreme-court-decision">Uber</a>, a ride-hailing company, were employees.</p>

  <p><strong>X</strong> (formerly Twitter) sued <strong>Media Matters</strong>, a watchdog group that last week published a report claiming that prominent brands had seen their advertisements placed next to incendiary and antisemitic tweets. The report triggered an advertiser exodus. X says the ad placements were “manufactured, inorganic and extraordinarily rare”; Media Matters called the lawsuit “frivolous.”</p>
